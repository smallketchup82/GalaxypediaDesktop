# GalaxypediaDesktop
Experimental Desktop Apps for the [Galaxypedia](https://robloxgalaxy.wiki)
Built upon [nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier).

## Purpose
Having a desktop app for the Galaxypedia makes it easier to switch from the Galaxy game to the Galaxypedia. It's a simple alt+tab.

## Platforms
The app currently works on Windows and MacOS. Linux is no longer prebuilt. To run the Galaxypedia on linux you will have to build the program yourself by following the steps in Development. Do note that it might be unstable.

## Development
Pull requests are welcome! Feel free to help with creating a desktop application for the Galaxypedia

### Manually Building
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Each .js script in the repository builds the app for a specific platform. To run them use `node <file>`

### Developing
Make sure that you're familiar with the [Nativefier API docs](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/blob/master/API.md). Once you've got a good understanding of the Nativefier API, you can help develop by making pull requests where you see fit.

Thanks!
